 ### What is Strife?
 Strife is just a name I've come up with for this project, it doesn't really mean anything, I needed a project name and at the time I was plaing the FF VII Remake. Ta-da!
 
 ### What is Strife for?
 I'm just going to be experimenting with various things I've wanted to learn for a while. I get a lot of naysayers when it comes to trying new things and suggesting it's too complicated or hard! Hopefully I can use this project as an example to prove those naysayers wrong and help them see the way. 
 
 ### List of things in Strife
 
 So far I've set up: 
 * Swagger
 * Authentication and Authorization using Auth0
 * Blazor wasm
 * Docker
